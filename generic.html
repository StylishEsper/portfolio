									<p>Hello, I'm a programmer and game developer. I am based in Ontario, Canada. I've been 
										programming since 2019 and developing games since 2020. I recently graduated from 
										college with a 3-year advanced diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis. I know 
										a variety of programming languages (mostly OOP languages). My favourites are C#, C++, 
										Java, VB, PHP, and HTML5. I specialize in game development, but I have other skills 
										such as database management (SQL), web development, QA, UI design, 2D art, and SEO.
									</p>
									<p>I grew up playing video games (and I still do), so it has become a passion of mine. 
										After I developed around 3 games without the use of a game engine, I moved on to 
										Unity. I picked it up pretty quickly since I had prior game development knowledge, 
										and I've been developing games with it since. I'm currently working on a unique 
										mobile game that is very close to completion, along with some other video game and 
										image processing projects.
									</p>
									<p>Game development is just a fun hobby of mine. In my spare time, I mostly spend it 
										developing games. I enjoy web and software development as well. I'm currently
										working for a small web development firm known as AllAboutWebServices. I update,
										build, and manage websites for clients as per their requirements. Also, I offer freelance
										game development (and other) services on Fiverr.
